## About the Game

In **Worn Out**, you play as a little cellphone called Kopia Boy with a big problem: due to a malfunction in its circuits, it consumes battery at an alarming rate!  
Your mission is to guide the poor Kopia Boy through a challenging maze and reach as far as possible before the battery runs out.

## Main Mechanics

- **Battery Drain:**  
  Kopia Boy's battery is constantly depleting. Every movement and action consumes precious energy, so plan your route carefully!

- **Maze Exploration:**  
  Navigate through a labyrinth filled with twists and turns. The further you go, the harder it gets!

- **Survival Challenge:**  
  There are no enemies—your greatest adversary is time and your own battery. How far can you get before Kopia Boy powers down?
